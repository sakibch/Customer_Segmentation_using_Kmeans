# Customer_Segmentation_using_Kmeans

* There are many models for clustering out there. In this notebook, we will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them. 
* Despite its simplicity, the K-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data. 
* **In this notebook, we learn how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.**

Some real-world applications of k-means:

* Customer segmentation
* Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
* Pattern recognition
* Machine learning
* Data compression

In this notebook we practice k-means clustering with 2 examples:
* k-means on a random generated dataset
* Using k-means for customer segmentation
